          <p>Sample Recipe:</p>
          <p><b> Vegetable Frittata</b> - Makes 8 servings as a first course</p>
          <p>
            You may wonder how a frittata came to be in a cookbook by someone
            who was raised in an Austrian-Jewish household in Queens, New York.
            Spending the first five years of my life in Italy, before we came to
            the United States as refugees, has forever made Italy a special
            place for me. I love Italy and go there often. It was, and still is,
            a haven for me - its food, its people, and many warm memories.
            <span id="dots">...</span
            ><span id="more">
              This frittata is filled with a variety of fresh vegetables and has
              a wonderful flavor. Frittata, remember, can be served shortly
              after being removed from the oven, or it can be cooled to warm.
              Serve it for brunch, with salad, or for a light, late dinner, with
              good bread. 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 large Spanish onion, thinly
              sliced 3 garlic cloves, minced 3 summer squash, ends removed and
              sliced 1/4 inch thick 3 zucchini, ends removed and sliced 1/4 inch
              thick 3 bell peppers (a red, a green, and a yellow) cored, seeded
              and ribs removed, and cut into 1/2-inch strips 1/2 pound (8
              ounces) sliced mushrooms 6 extra-large eggs 1/4 cup heavy cream 1
              teaspoon coarse kosher salt 1 teaspoon fresh pepper 2 cups stale
              plain croutons, from day-old French bread 1/2 pound (8 ounces)
              cream cheese, cut into small cubes 2 cups grated Swiss cheese
              Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 10-inch-round, 2-inch-deep
              cake pan, and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over
              medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onion, garlic,
              squash, bell peppers, and mushrooms and sauté, stirring, until
              cooked, but still crisp-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the
              heat to cool slightly. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs,
              cream, salt, and pepper. Stir in the croutons until combined, then
              add the cream cheese and Swiss cheese and stir well again. Stir in
              the sautéed vegetables until completely incorporated. Pour the
              mixture into the prepared pan and level the top. Bake about 1
              hour, until firm. Check at the halfway point, and if the top is
              browning too quickly, lay a piece of foil loosely over the top of
              the pan. Let stand 10-15 minutes before serving slightly warm,
              when the frittata is at its very best.

              My Most Favorite Dessert Company Cookbook
            </h3>
            <p>Sample Recipe:</p>
            <p><b> My Most Favorite Sugar Cookies</b></p>
            <p>Makes about 3 dozen 2-inch round cookies</p>
            <p>
              Sometimes the simpler a cookie is the better it is, and these are
              simple and fun to make. Use small cutters for dainty cookies to
              serve with tea, or big ones for Halloween treats. Sprinkle them
              with colored sugars or frost them. Let children cut them out or
              bake a batch by yourself on a rainy afternoon. There is nothing
              like the aroma of the sugary dough as it perfumes your house.

                My Most Favorite Sugar Crust (see below) Granulated sugar, for
                sprinkling 1. Preheat the over to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large
                cookie sheets with parchment paper. 2. Let the dough stand at
                room temperature to soften slightly before rolling. On a lightly
                floured surface, roll out the dough a generous 1/4 inch thick.
                With your favorite cookie cutters, but out cookies and place
                them, 1 inch apart, on a the lined sheets. Sprinkle generously
                with granulated sugar. Gather up the scraps, reroll the dough,
                cut out, and sugar cookies until you have used up all the
                dough.. 3. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until just golden on the
                bottom. With a metal spatula, transfer to wire racks to cool.
                Store, in layers, in air-tight containers for up to 1 week. My
                Most Favorite Sugar Crust Makes enough dough for two 9-to
                10-inch pies or tarts A word of advice before you make the
                dough: Remove the margarine from the refrigerator right before
                you plan to use it. Cold margarine creams more efficiently than
                softened margarine does, and your goal is a well-crafted crust,
                which begins with the margarine and sugar mixture. 12
                tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) cold unsalted margarine 1/3 cup sugar
                1 extra-large egg 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups
                all-purpose flour 1. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer
                fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the margarine with the
                sugar on medium speed until fluffy. 2. In a small bowl, beat the
                egg together lightly with the vanilla. With the mixer running
                add the egg mixture to the margarine mixture and beat until they
                are incorporated. 3. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the
                four ingredients, a cup at a time, beating until a ball of dough
                forms around the paddle. 4. With your hands, gather the dough
                into a ball, and pat it into a large, flat round. Divide the
                round in half, shape each half into a disk and wrap each disk in
                plastic wrap. Chill the disks in the refrigerator for at least 2
                hours, preferably 3 to 4 hours, or until firm. To freeze - The
                dough, wrapped well in plastic wrap, may be frozen for up to 1
                month. To defrost - Thaw in the plastic wrap at room
                temperature.
